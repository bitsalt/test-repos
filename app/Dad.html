    Dad where do I even begin. Even when I couldnt understand your words you were there teaching me.
    Long before I ever knew anything about why I was here you were guiding me. You stood as a tall superhero armed 
    with a silver laptop and cool bike. You were a role model and a hand to push me the right direction. 
    Even when those directions scared me you gave me the small pushes I needed to keep my head up.
    From helping me see the world with cheerful eyes to helping me find my passion in the world. 
    Im sure none of it was easy. I dont doubt there were days filled with "whats wrong with this little shit". 
    I cant say I blame you. But I will always respect and admire you for being the super Dad in my life.
    Thank you for helping me grow into the man I am today. There will be many more moments for us to share Im sure.
