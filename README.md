#CI/CI Pipeline
Git commits to this project trigger multiple actions:

Working...
* Push an image of the project to dockerHub: bitsalt/frujo
* Push to Jenkins for testing

Moved the Jenkins push to 'working' but Jenkins asked me to fix the proxy settins, so...

Not yet validated
* Deployment from Jenkins on passing tests
